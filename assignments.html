				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					This page will give you tips on how to effectively deal with assignments.		
				</p>

			<section>
				<h2>Start early</h2>
				<p>
					Whatever type of assignment you have coming up it is always a good idea to start early. Beginning assignments earlier will greatly reduce stress and make it much easier to be organised.

				<h2>Remove distractions</h2>
				<p>
					Whilst Netflix and social media platforms such as Instragram and Snapchat are staples in most students’ lives, it is important to know when you are getting too absorbed in what you are watching or doing, that you are no longer concentrating on your work.
				</p>

				<h2>Plan ahead</h2>
				<p>
					To make things easier on yourself, it is always better to plan ahead and get everything you need done than just winging it. You can create a plan and choose what times you will work on each assignment.

				<h2>Make it interesting</h2>
				<p>
					Not every topic you have to work on will be interesting, but there are ways to make it fun. For instance, find a particular element of the subject that you enjoy and start by focusing on that topic.

				<h2>Organise your study space</h2>
				<p>
					As the saying goes, a tidy room a tidy mind. You’re not going to be able to focus on your work if your study space is covered in clothes, books, and all sorts of random items. If you clean up your study space you will find it much easier to concentrate.

				<h2>Study with friends</h2>
				<p>
					Studying with friends always makes assignments and revision seem a little less daunting. With other people around you working on their own assignments it puts you in the right frame of mind to begin tackling your work.

				<h2>Take regular breaks</h2>
				<p>
					When studying, it’s important to concentrate and get a lot done but you also don’t want to study for too long. Studying makes your brain get fatigued and after a while it needs a rest
				</p>

				<h2>Don’t be afraid to ask for help</h2>
				<p>
					It is never anything to be embarrassed about or nervous to do, as everyone will be struggling with something at some point and need help.
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Snack on “brain food” and drink water!</h2>
				<p>
					Vegetables, fruit, peanut butter and coffee. These are four of the best foods to eat and drink when studying. 
				</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>Reward yourself</h2>
				<p>
					Don’t forget to reward yourself for your efforts! After a grueling assignment is completed, make sure you do something to reward your hard work, such as spending time with friends, going to the movies, or even having the luxury of just doing nothing.
