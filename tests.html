				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					You can be given tests for many different subjects, mainly ones based on theory like Maths. A test must be completed within a set time frame, without anything to help you. It can be stressful but there are ways to make tests and exams easy.

				<h2>Give yourself enough time to study</h2>
				<p>
					Don't leave it until the last minute. While some students do seem to thrive on last-minute cramming, it's widely accepted that (for most of us) this is not the best way to approach an exam. To help sort out your time management, set up a timetable for your study.

				<h2>Make sure you are prepared</h2>
				<p>
					Before a test, make sure you are prepared to face it. Get lots of sleep the night before, check that you have revised everything and come in with a positive attitude. It makes a big difference when you make an effort to do well.

				<h2>Practice on old exams</h2>
				<p>
					One of the most effective ways to prepare for exams is to practice taking past versions. This helps you get used to the format of the questions, and - if you time yourself - can also be good practice for making sure you spend the right amount of time on each section.
